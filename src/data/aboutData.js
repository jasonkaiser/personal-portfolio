const aboutText = `
I'm a second-year Information Technology student at the International Burch University (IBU), specializing in full-stack development with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies. My passion lies in building complete, user-focused web applications that are not only functional but also visually engaging.

In addition to my technical coursework, I have hands-on experience with graphic design and UI/UX prototyping using tools like Figma. This allows me to bridge the gap between design and development, ensuring that the user experience is always intuitive and aesthetically pleasing.

Beyond academics, I’ve had the opportunity to assist and guide fellow students by providing instruction in Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This experience has sharpened my ability to communicate complex technical concepts clearly, work collaboratively, and foster a positive learning environment skills that are equally valuable in real-world development teams.

I'm a fast learner, highly adaptable, and deeply committed to continuous improvement. Whether it's solving backend logic, optimizing user interfaces, or exploring new technologies, I’m always eager to take on new challenges and expand my skill set. My goal is to contribute meaningfully to projects that make an impact, while constantly evolving as a developer and problem solver.
